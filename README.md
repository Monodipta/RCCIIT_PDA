## Overview

Placement Data Analytics and Prediction (RCCIIT_PDA) is designed to simplify the process of analyzing past placement data and forecasting future trends. It helps educational institutions and placement cells make data-driven decisions. The application processes raw placement data, performs statistical analysis, and provides meaningful insights through visualizations.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: In-depth analysis of historical placement data, including success rates, industry trends, and department-wise breakdowns.
- **Prediction Models**: Machine learning techniques integrated to predict student placement probabilities based on their academic and extracurricular profiles.
- **Custom Visualizations**: Graphical representation of insights, such as bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for data input and result visualization.
- **Scalable Solution**: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Monodipta/RCCIIT_PDA.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd RCCIIT_PDA
   ```

3. **Compile the Java Source Code**:
   ```bash
   javac -d bin src/*.java
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   java -cp bin Main
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Input**:
   - Prepare a CSV or Excel file containing historical placement data. Ensure the data includes fields like `Student Name`, `Roll Number`, `Department`, `CGPA`, `Placement Status`, etc.
   - Load the data into the application through the input interface.

2. **Analysis**:
   - The application will process the data and generate insights, such as placement statistics, company preferences, and department-specific trends.

3. **Prediction**:
   - For new students, input their academic and personal details. The prediction module will calculate their placement probability and display the results.

4. **Export Results**:
   - Save the analyzed data and predictions as reports in a downloadable format.
